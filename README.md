# This is a foundational project for open source best practices

Here’s a step-by-step checklist of everything we’ll configure — in smart order:

⸻

🔧 PROJECT FOUNDATION 1. 📁 Repository Structure
• Base folders, naming conventions, directory layout 2. 📄 Essential Files
• README.md – Clear, welcoming intro + setup
• LICENSE – Choose an open source license
• .gitignore – Ignore the right files
• CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
• CONTRIBUTING.md

⸻

🚥 WORKFLOW & AUTOMATION 3. ⚙️ GitHub Actions
• Basic CI: test/lint/workflows
• Auto-label + triage setup
• PR + commit message best practices 4. 📝 Issue & PR Templates
• Bug, feature, question, documentation templates
• PR template for consistency 5. 🏷️ Labels & Projects
• Create helpful labels
• Set up GitHub Projects for issue tracking

⸻

📦 RELEASE & MAINTENANCE 6. 📜 CHANGELOG.md
• Setup with Keep a Changelog
• Manual or automated (release-drafter) 7. 🔖 Versioning & Releases
• Semantic versioning setup
• GitHub releases and tags
• Optional: auto-tagging tools

⸻

👥 COMMUNITY & COLLAB 8. 💬 Discussions & Community
• Enable GitHub Discussions
• Add a welcome message
• Add SECURITY.md for reporting vulnerabilities 9. ✨ Contributor Recognition
• Use all-contributors or GitHub built-ins
• Add badges and acknowledgments

✅ Step 1: Repository Structure & Naming Conventions

📦 Recommended Repo Structure

```
my-awesome-project/
├── .github/                # GitHub-specific configs (workflows, templates)
│   ├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
│   └── workflows/
├── src/                    # Your source code
├── tests/                  # Unit/integration tests
├── docs/                   # Project documentation
├── .gitignore              # Files to ignore in Git
├── README.md               # Project overview and usage
├── LICENSE                 # Open source license
├── CONTRIBUTING.md         # How to contribute
├── CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md      # Contributor behavior expectations
├── CHANGELOG.md            # Version history
└── package.json / pyproject.toml / etc.  # Project config/manifest (depends on stack)
```

🏷️ Naming Conventions
• repo name: use kebab-case or snake_case, avoid spaces/caps
✅ Examples:
• my-awesome-project
• json-schema-validator
• cli-tool-starter
• branches:
• main (or dev as default working branch)
• feature branches: feature/add-auth, fix/typo-in-readme, docs/setup-guide
• issues/PRs:
Use prefixes in titles for clarity:
• [DOCS], [BUG], [FEATURE], [TASK], [REFACTOR]

✅ Step 2: Add Essential Files

These are the backbone of any open source repo — they explain what the project is, how to use it, how to contribute, and what the rules are.

📄 Essential Files to Add

Here’s what we’ll create, one by one:

File
Purpose
README.md
Project overview, setup, usage, etc.
LICENSE
Legal open source license
.gitignore
Tells Git what to ignore
CONTRIBUTING.md
Guide for contributors (we already made one âœ…)
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
Defines behavior expectations
CHANGELOG.md
Track changes across versions

📝 1. Create README.md

Here’s a simple starting point:

````md

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-user/my-awesome-project.git
